Anjana's ML Classification Project about HR-Employee-Attrition

Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?): 
Yes, it is well organized with an excellent introduction.

Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
Yes, the input features make sense given the target featur 'Attrition'. The input variables seem like they relate, 'OverTime, 'Age', 'TenureToPromotionRatio', 'MonthlyIncome', and 'JobSatisfaction'. These are likely to capture burnout, demographics and career progression.

Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)

The results are clearly explained and one clearly had better performance.

Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

It was very clear how they compared the two models in a table.
